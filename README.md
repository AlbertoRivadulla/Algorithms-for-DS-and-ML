# Test of algorithms in Data Science

I implement these algorithms in a library written in C++, called DSAlgorithms.
The methods can be called from Python, using the `ctypes` module.
The file `tests.ipynb` contains some examples using these functions.

### Algorithms implemented

- Dimensional reduction techniques
    - Principal component analysis
- Clustering
    - K-means
    - Agglomerative clustering

### Work in progress

- Dimensional reduction techniques
    - t-SNE
    - Kernel PCA
    - Factor analysis
- Clustering
    - DBSCAN algorithm
- Neural networks
    - Deep neural network
    - Convolutional neural network
