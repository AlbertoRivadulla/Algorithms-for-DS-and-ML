# Implementations and tests of some algorithms in Data Science

I implement these algorithms in a library written in C++, called DSAlgorithms.
The methods can be called from Python, using the `ctypes` module.
The files inside the directory `tests_python` contain some examples using these functions.

### Algorithms implemented

- Dimensional reduction techniques
    - Principal component analysis
    - t-SNE
- Clustering
    - K-means
    - Agglomerative clustering
    - DBSCAN algorithm
